Great — below is a complete, organized list of all endpoints your backend exposes (based on the code you and I added) together with dummy request bodies and quick Postman/curl examples you can paste into Postman. For every protected endpoint remember to set the header:
Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>
(Use the token returned by login.)

(If not implemented yet, use DB queries or add endpoints later.)

Global error responses
When validation or other errors occur, the API returns a structured error JSON. Example (validation error):
{
  "timestamp": "2025-12-08T12:00:00Z",
  "status": 400,
  "error": "Validation Failed",
  "message": "Validation error",
  "path": "/api/bookings",
  "validationErrors": ["Start datetime must be before end datetime"]
}
Booking conflict example (HTTP 409):
{
  "timestamp": "2025-12-08T12:05:00Z",
  "status": 409,
  "error": "Conflict",
  "message": "Car is already booked for the selected time range",
  "path": "/api/bookings"
}

Quick Postman setup tips
	1. Create an environment variable {{baseUrl}} set to http://localhost:8080.
	2. Create a request to POST {{baseUrl}}/api/auth/login. After successful login, copy the returned accessToken into a variable {{token}}.
		○ In Postman, automate this with a test script that sets pm.environment.set("token", pm.response.json().accessToken).
	3. For protected requests, add a header:
		○ Key: Authorization
		○ Value: Bearer {{token}}
	4. For file uploads use Body -> form-data and add file field (type File).
	5. Use the dummy JSON bodies above for requests; edit IDs to match your seeded/generated IDs.

If you want, I can now:
	• generate a Postman collection (JSON) with all of the requests above populated (you can import into Postman directly),
or
	• create a single bash script using curl that runs through the full happy path (register → login → create location → create car → upload image → create booking → confirm booking → mark completed → create review).
Which would you like next?
